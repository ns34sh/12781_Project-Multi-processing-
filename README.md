# 12781_Project-Multi-processing-

This project aims to create a Python program to calculate the transfer force at all the beam-column junctions in a steel structure. Transfer force is the net axial force, from a beam and any connected brace members, for which the beam-column connection needs to be designed to ensure a safe force transfer. 
The Python program prompts the user to provide the path of csv data files with information related to structural geometry and member forces. The program also prompts the user for the load cases that need to be considered for calculating the transfer force. The output of the program will be the net transfer force, the maximum out of all the load cases, for all the beams in the structure.
The project in the second mini not only aims to evaluate transfer forces at all the beam-column junctions (rather than at a single beam-column junction as done in mini-1) but also utilizes parallel processing to do the computation efficiently. This approach should reduce the time taken to compute transfer forces for large structures with thousands of members. The results of the time taken for parallel and sequential computation will be added in the conclusion section of this report.
